# OneDrive Better Light Mode

Using Powershell script and Resource Hacker, apply different set of OneDrive icons, to resemble macOS design for light mode.

Currently in development.

## How to

- Clone repository locally
- Run _EasyLauncher.bat_ to install new icons
- Run _EasyLauncher.bat -u_ to restore default icons

## Important notes

Keep in mind, that icon replacement is not permanent! Every OneDrive update will revert those icons to default, so the script would need to be re-run once OneDrive will be updated.

## Future plans
- more light mode tray icons
- bigger tray icons set for both light and dark mode
- remove Windows 10 folder from default OneDrive icon
